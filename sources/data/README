SYNOPSIS
     ./my_pacman.sh

DESCRIPTION
     my_pacman is an ASCII console game.

     The goal is to obtain the best score.

     In order to move, you can use either:
     - the directional arrows
     - WASD (or equivalent on non-QWERTY keyboards)

     Press ESC to quit.

     Scoreboard :
     10 pts : Pac-gum
     50 pts : Super pac-gum
     100 pts : Cherry
     200 pts : Fearful Ghost
     300 pts : Strawberry (level 2+)
     500 pts : Orange (level 3+)
     700 pts : Apple (level 5+)
     1000 pts : Melon (level 7+)
     2000 pts : Galboss (level 9+)
     3000 pts : Bell (level 11+)
     5000 pts : Key (level 13+)

     If a Ghost touches you, you lose a life.

     You gain +1 life every 10.000 points.

     Eat all the pac-gums to get to the next level.

     Getting to the next level leads to:
     - lowered super pac-gums duration (cap at level 21)
     - more aggressive Ghost AIs (cap at level 16)

     Each Ghost has its own AI.
